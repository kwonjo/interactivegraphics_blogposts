# Blog Post: Portfolio and Reflection

1. Portfolio

All five art pieces are included in the portfolio.  

2. Reflection of p5js

In this course, we started out with learning basic rectangles and circles. It was interesting how we started out with basic geometry to complicated data visualizations and back-end components at the end of the semester. The most exciting part for me was learning the unlimited boundary of p5.js. Learning different topics in class and looking at other peer' work were helpful to realize that p5.js has no limitation in creating art. In addition, critiquing peers' work was helpful. I got to think about my project over again and make some changes. I also got inspired by other works. 

The most challenging part was also the coding. Even though I would write the exact codes as the example, I would not get the same results and have errors. As Matt stated in class, coding requires time to get use to and to get better at. Watching many examples and videos were necessary. I really thought the office hours were helpful. Many of my unanswered questions from google and Shiffman were solved with Matt's help.
