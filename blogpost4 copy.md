# Blog Post 4: Algorithmic Design

### Letting Go of the Control

Algorithmic designs are used for complex geometires and is based on architectural mathematical theories. The advantage to algorithmic coding is that people can use simple codes to create a complex art work(https://generativedesign.wordpress.com/2012/03/11/algorithmic-design/). 

Algorithmic design gives the user or the interface itself to have some control over the piece. I still wanted some control over my drawing. The content of the text was created with the 50 highest frequency lyrics from the five songs that were selected from the top 20 "happy" billboard chart. The content and the soundtrack being fixed enabled me to have control over the drawing. 

The parameters that I have used are "for loop" statements for the words to move around and shade images of pastel purple and pink. I used "if else" statement for mouseIsPressed to make the sound track and smiley face to appear and disappear. In order to make the words randomly move, I used "classes." I also used 

Using "classes" was challenging. I wanted the words to move a little up and down but they seem to overlap each other. Therefore, finding the right range for random(min,max) so that the words do not overlap so much was crucial. Although I changed the range, some texts are unavoidable to not overlap due to the random function. It may look more complicated and unstructured but it also gives the idea of chaos will all the 50 words of happiness together which I think gives a unique aesthetic touch to the drawing.
