Zach Leiberman is a software developer and he worked with typographers Pierre Smeets and Damien Aresta. They used a race car from Toyota to design a font. The car movements were tracked and it created a font with the data. It captured my interest due to its visual appeal at first. The font is very unique and watching the video allowed me to understand how it was created. The car movement cannot have many edges which led the font to be very curvy. The trio combination of interactions between the car, camera on the car, and the software created the output. I believe this physical interaction of creating art is interesting and something that I want to expand upon in the future.

This piece may is first attractive to me due to the chance operations of the change in the constant shapes and patterns on the wheel. I also liked how it would make a swirl and change for each time. It looks like it is reloading each time and the random geometries intrigue users to continue to cluck to see different chances. I looked into the codes and it did seem complicated. However, I found out about the different classes that the artist used and how a lot of math was required to create the circles.
