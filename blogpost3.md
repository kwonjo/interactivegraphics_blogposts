Zach Leiberman is a software developer and he worked with typographers Pierre Smeets and Damien Aresta. They used a race car from Toyota to design a font. The car movements were tracked and it created a font with the data. It captured my interest due to its visual appeal at first. The font is very unique and watching the video allowed me to understand how it was created. The car movement cannot have many edges which led the font to be very curvy. The trio combination of interactions between the car, camera on the car, and the software created the output. I believe this physical interaction of creating art is interesting and something that I want to expand upon in the future.

### 2.	all I know and then some by Addie Wagenknecht

This piece may have not used programming but it uses an algorithm. The text is painted with acrylic paint but the texts are like for loops. They are repetitive. "I will not download things that get me into trouble." and "I will download things" are repeating over and over again. I think the artist is trying to make her point with repetition. In addition, I like this piece because it uses text and I want to use text in my project. This repetition can be made with p5js and other programming languages for visualization.
