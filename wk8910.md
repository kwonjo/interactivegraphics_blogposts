# Interactive graphics NOTES ON WEEK 8, 9, and 10 (VISUALIZATION)

## Week 8 (Feb 21, 2018)

1. Lecture
- https://d3js.org/ (data-dtriven documents)
- Differences between p5js and javascript
    -javascript: broad language
    -includes many libraries such as p5js
    -make your own library
- Open Source: people can edit the information 
- Why would we use classes in DATA VISUALIZATION?
    - flexibility to change the shapes and move around
    - make a class in a different js file
    - html write the new .js file in
    - preload: loading all the data before drawing

```javascript
function preload(){
    table = loadTable('data.csv', 'csv');
}
function draw(){
    for () 
    bubbles[i].display();
    bubbles[i].rollover(mouseX, mouseY);

}
function loadData(){
bubbles = [];

bubbles[i] = new Bubble(x, y, d, n);
}

rollover 
```

- data.csv
- csv file save as csv
- rollover(px, py)


2. Arrays
- holder of objects
- counting starts with 0 

3. House Cleaning
- Github pages (create pages to share)
- fill() by order...it's a recipe order matters
- push and pop: rotation of text
- textAlign 

4. Add images
```javascript
var images =[];

function preload(){
    table= loadTable('data/workbook1.csv", "header");
    for(var i=0; i<5; i==){
        images[i] = loadImage('images/' + i + ".jpg")
        loadImage
    }
}

class Bubble{
this.photo = photo;
}
```

5. p5js libraries
- scenemanager
- Rita

6. API (Application Programming interface)
- Bag of data
    Ex) Uber uses Google Map's API
- https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

7. Good design?
- Attention to detail
- every pixel on canvas should be defended (Why did you pick this? Why is it necessary?)
- stand alone without the artist's explanation

8. Good art?
- Defend your work(have answers to what you did what?)

9. Exibit: Final
- Downtown Durham

10. Bootstrap
