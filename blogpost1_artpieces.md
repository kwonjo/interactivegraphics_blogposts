### 1.	Eyecode (2007) by Golan Levin 

[Here's a link to the piece](http://www.flong.com/projects/eyecode/)

I was looking through Golan Levin's work and this piece instantly caught my attention. All the different eyes of all the views of the art are displayed on the screen. It's interesting how the art work is interacting with the viewers. It captures the viewers' eyes and they can find their own eyes when they blink. They can also look at other people's eyes that have been captured. This allows viewers to also interact with other viewers. They can see how other people have been viewing the display. Levin's Eyecode is interactive so it's constantly changing, and it can never be the same. The constant change in the art is another uniqueness that attracted me.

### 2.	Lumen by Arvind Sanjeev

I've read many articles about augmented and virtual reality. However, this work is beyond what I have imagined of virtual reality. This mixed reality has so many possibilities in art and other parts of the society. As the video mentions, it can be used in museums, cities, and escape rooms. Story telling will not be limited on screens, VR glasses, or smartphones. Most museums use headphones for explanations of the art works but Lumen will allow it to go beyond headphones. Headphones are limited in giving information because only narratives can be delivered to the visitors. Lumen will give more information with its moving projections. In cities, Lumen can be used as a tour guide. In Does place affect user engagement and understanding? Mobile learner perceptions on the streets of New York by Anthony Cocciolo and Debbie Rabina, people learn about New York by using a GeoStoryteller, a program with a place-based learning, for two hours. The article states advantages and disadvantages of the program which is on the boundary line between augmented and mixed reality. Many of them were frustrated using technology with the glitches and the overcrowded population of New York. Although Lumen may have similar problems to GeoStoryteller, it would definitely be more user friendly than using an iPad.
